# Going Live
I have spent the past day and a half working on putting this site together and getting it to the point where I would be happy with putting it out into the world. This is something that i've wanted to put together for a while now, but mostly after taking a step back and actually looking at my previous personal website. 

Having now put something together that I'm pretty proud of, here are a few of the main lessons I've learned from doing so :
- I'm not a huge fan of the direction AI is taking us, but it is a great tool when properly used.
  - While developing this site, I used Cursor and ChatGPT to greatly accelerate my ability to actually ship something. Historically, I would get myself hyped to work on a project, dive deep into the minutiae of whatever technology I was using, and then stall out once I realized how much work remained to reach the end goal. That’s probably more a reflection on myself than anything else, but with the help of AI tools, I was able to push through those speed bumps and actually finish something.
  - This isn’t bragging about being able to churn out code faster than before, just an honest observation from using these tools on a project from start to finish. I’m not saying I couldn’t have achieved this without them; they simply helped me get out of my own way.
  - This also isn’t an endorsement of some god-like power of LLMs or a claim that they’re going to permanently reshape the world. It’s more about finally accepting that these tools **are here**, and that incorporating them thoughtfully into a workflow has real, tangible benefits.
- Another point would have been nice to have here.

Some Useful Resources that I used:
1. [Raja Tamil's Dev.to Post on Deploying to Firebase](https://dev.to/rajatamil/deploying-vuejs-app-to-firebase-hosting-in-a-minute-559l)

More Things I want to Add:
- Github Actions
  - Auto generate index.json and tag_index.json in the content repo on push
- Better Markdown Handling
  - The Library I'm currently using is great but still need a little help
